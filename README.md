<h2 align="center">Conway's Game of Life (Experiment)</h2>

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of living organisms based on simple rules. It's a fascinating and addictive way to explore emergent behavior and complexity in a simple system.

This project is an experimental implementation of the Game of Life to life in the web browser using Blazor WebAssembly.

### Rules that Make The Game of Life Possible

The Game of Life follows these simple rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
